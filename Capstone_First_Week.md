# Which city to visit when you want to see museums?
## 1. Introduction

### a. Background
When travelers go on vacation, they try to reduce costs by spending less on transportation.  Many will avoid renting a car and want a city where everything is close by.  These travelers are trying to determine the best city to travel to with the most amount of museums close by.  This project will focus on comparing multiple cities within the United States to determine which location has the highest density of museums.  

### b. Problem
We want to determine which city has the highest density of museums which would require the least amount of traveling within the city.

### c. Target Audience
The target audience is anyone looking for an educational vacation with multiple museums within a close area.

## Data Section

### a. Data
FourSquare API will be where the data comes from because museums can be captured with a code of 4bf58dd8d48988d181941735.  I'll collect data for the most popular cities for museums which is San Francisco, CA, Baltimore, MD, Boston, MA, Philadelphia, PA, New Orleans, LA, Seattle, WA, Los Angeles, CA, Chicago, IL, Washington DC, and New York, NY.  This will provide me with a good population to compare to determine who has the highest density of museums.  This analysis will allow for our museum goers to be able to experience as much as possible during their trip.

### b. Methodology
The method to collecting and comparing all of this data is to compare all of the top museums within the selected cities.  Each city will be displayed on a map with all museum datapoints present to see which map is the most clustered together.  The mean distance between the city and the museums will be calculated to ultimately determine which city has the highest density of museums.  Once the data is collected and analyzed, we will be able to come to the final conclusion and have a solution for our target audience.
