## Which city to visit when you want to see museums?
# Introduction
Museum goers all over the world are trying to determine the best place to travel to.  This capstone project will focus on comparing multiple cities within the US to determine which location has the highest density of museums.  The goal is to find the best city for museum goers to travel to so they can experience as much as possible within the city.
# Data Section
FourSquare API will be where my data comes from because I can capture all museums with a code of 4bf58dd8d48988d181941735.  I'll collect data for the most popular cities for museums which is San Francisco, Baltimore, Boston, Philadelphia, New Orleans, Seattle, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington DC, and New York.  This will provide me with a good population to compare to determine who has the highest density of museums which will allow for our museum goers to be able to experience as much as possible during their trip.
