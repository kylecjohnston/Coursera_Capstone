# Which city to visit when you want to see museums?
## 1. Introduction

### a. Background
Museum goers all over the United States are trying to determine the best city to travel to.  This project will focus on comparing multiple cities within the United States to determine which location has the highest density of museums.  The goal is to find the best city for museum goers to travel to and to settle the debate of which city is the best to learn.  Travelers want to travel to a city to experience as many closely located museums as possible.

### b. Problem
The main problem is to determine which city is the best to visit that has a lot of museums close to the area?

### c. Target Audience
Anyone looking for an educational vacation with multiple museums close by.

## Data Section

### a. Data
FourSquare API will be where my data comes from because I can capture all museums with a code of 4bf58dd8d48988d181941735.  I'll collect data for the most popular cities for museums which is San Francisco, Baltimore, Boston, Philadelphia, New Orleans, Seattle, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington DC, and New York.  This will provide me with a good population to compare to determine who has the highest density of museums.  This analysis will allow for our museum goers to be able to experience as much as possible during their trip.

### b. Methodology
The method to collecting and comparing all of this data is to compare all of the top museums within the selected cities.  Each city will be displayed on a map with all museum datapoints present to see which map is the most clustered together.  The mean distance between the city and the museums will be calculated to ultimately determine which city is the best to visit that has a lot of museums close together.  Once the data is collected and analyzed we will be able to come to the final conclusion and have a solution for our target audience.
